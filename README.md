# Binary-Integer-Linear-Programming
We provide simple R-functions to approximately solve many large binary integer programs (BILPs).  Our approach involves LP relaxation of the BILP and collapsed dual solution of the corresponding dual LP followed by a simple sort.  For large problems, the resulting binary solution value is close to the relaxed dual bound.  Using this approach, we were able to solve a maximization BILP with 100 constraints and 50,000 variables in about four minutes on a beefy Dell PC.  The resulting BILP value was within 99.96% of the dual upper bound.  Results for a minimization BILP were similar.
